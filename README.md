Merry Christmas Kiaya!

## So what did Cousin Charlie actually get me for Chistmas this year?
A domain name is a way for other people to easily get things that you've
made from places that you put them on the internet.  It's (kind of) like an address for
your webpage.

Now, if you want to make a webpage, you can share it with your friends, family, or whoever you want, 
just by telling them what is common knowledge, "kiayahussion.rocks"!

## That's cool and all Cuzzo, but how does my webpage work?
Well, when you type your domain name into Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
(please don't use Edge or Internet Explorer kids!) it turns that name into
an IP address and then it uses that
IP address to get the webpage from another computer on the internet.  It reaches out to the other computer 
with that address and basically says, "Kiaya Hussion wants to see your web page".
To which the other computer replies, "Okay, here you go!" and sends back a bunch of text
a lot like you're reading now.

And that's because all webpages are is just text written in very a special way!  That's
how we code the whole internet (You can see the text that makes any page by "right-clicking"
your mouse on that page and then clicking the "View page source" option.  Try it on this 
page)!  All the code that was used to make your card can
be found and viewed in this public GitHub repository.  Take a look through it and see if 
you can see what it's doing, you might be surprised at what you can tell.  I might even
be able to show you how to change it to say what you want!

And finally if you've read this far, text me the following code for
the rest of your christmas present...bd7fc3.  Don't tell your brother or your cousins!  You
each need to do your own reading and you have different codes!

And don't forget Cousin Charlie is just a cell phone and a parkway away!
